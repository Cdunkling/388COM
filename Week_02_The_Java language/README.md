# The Java language

Hmm... Java... Java is huge, where should we start?

In their latest book [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (2nd Edition)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0134171454/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1443519722&sr=1-1&keywords=android+big+nerd+ranch) the authors claimed that:

> "... you need to be familiar with Java, including classes and objects, interfaces, listeners, packages, inner classes, anonymous inner classes, and generic classes. If these ideas do not ring a bell, you will be in the weeds by page 2 ..."

I couldn't agree more. So we'll start from there.
