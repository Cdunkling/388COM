# Data persistence

Data persistence refers to the fact that data need to persist through app life cycle changes. In other words, even if you close the app completely the data need to be restored when the user navigates back to the app. There're several ways to save data in Android. In the 1st lab, we'll look at using SharedPreferences and File APIs. In the 2nd lab, we'll see how to save data using SQL databases.
